		<p>We are a teaching-focused group at Cal Poly Pomona with the aim for undergraduate and masters students to contribute to peer-reviewed research and small molecule activation while learning a variety of inorganic chemistry techniques including air-free synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, and computations. All are welcome here, regardless of race, disability, gender, nationality, religion, and sexual orientation. Our research laboratory has options for both in-person and remote research, and group meetings are either hybrid or over Zoom. Contact us if you're interested in doing research.</p>
